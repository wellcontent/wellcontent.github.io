<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>It seems to be a cycle at this point. They push an update, get backlash, apologize, retract their update, and do the same thing over again.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s go over what the updates actually entail, and then see how this plays into Twitchâ€™s strategy.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="update-1-advertisements">Update #1: Advertisements</h2>

<p>The first update applies to advertisements.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/#12-advertisements">Section 12 of their Terms of Service</a> states that â€œ[t]hird-party advertising networks are not allowed to serve advertising through the Twitch Servicesâ€, which can mean to include embedded advertisements or banner ads.</p>

<p>Burn-in ads and audio are now not allowed. These include embedded advertisements and banner ads.</p>

<p>The reason they made these changes is because theyâ€™re trying to get brands to directly work with Twitch. And they want more control over the events ecosystem and major productions displayed on Twitch, so they can take the deal and cut.</p>

<p>Theyâ€™ve done this with Esports events in the past, so this isnâ€™t entirely new.</p>

<p>By forcing brands to work directly with them, Twitch is also pushing talent agencies out of the equation by running through their own sales team.</p>

<p>But Twitch isnâ€™t able to handle this task themselves, because theyâ€™re already unprofitable and bleeding employees with all the Amazon layoffs.</p>

<p>This will also destroy this particular source of income for smaller creators, limiting creatorsâ€™ ability to deliver on-screen advertising. Creators and sponsors have built this way of advertising into the creator economy, so limiting it hurts creators directly.</p>

<p>The policy said that burn-in ads (like branded sponsorship codes or logos) shouldnâ€™t take up more than 3% of the full stream screen. Thatâ€™s 332x187 pixels on a 1920x1080 resolution stream.</p>

<p>As of now, creators have until July 1st to make changes necessary to comply with this rule or they risk breaking their contract.</p>

<p>But does Twitch really have the capacity to enforce this policy?</p>

<p>Theyâ€™d have to go by every streamer individually (there are over 1 million streamers per month) to check if their branded content is taking up less than 3% of their screen.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="update-2-simulcasting">Update #2: Simulcasting</h2>

<p>The second update applies to simulcasting.</p>

<p>Simulcasting, or multistreaming, is where you stream to multiple platforms at the same time.</p>

<p>You are allowed to multistream to mobile-first competitors like Instagram and TikTok. Previously, this was not allowed for Twitch Affiliates and Partners when it came to direct competitors like YouTube and Facebook. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/#11-simulcasting">Section 11 of their Terms of Service</a> first stated that â€œ[w]hen you are streaming live on the Twitch Services you may not simultaneously live stream or broadcast (â€œSimulcastâ€) on any other â€œTwitch-like Service,â€ meaning any web-based network, platform, or service that supports live streaming of user generated content.â€</p>

<p>But as of October 2023, Twitch has updated its policy to <strong>allow simulcasting</strong> for all creators, <strong>regardless of contract status</strong>. Now, Section 11 states that â€œ[w]hen you are streaming live on the Twitch Services you may simultaneously live stream or broadcast (â€œSimulcastâ€) on any other network, platform, or service that supports live streaming of user generated content.â€</p>

<p>This change lifts exclusivity restrictions, letting streamers broadcast their content simultaneously on Twitch and other platforms. However, Twitch still imposes certain guidelines.</p>

<p>The Simulcast Guidelines state that streamers are required to keep the same quality of their Twitch streams on other platforms, so you canâ€™t for example stream at a higher bitrate to YouTube while simulcasting at a lower bitrate to Twitch. You may also not provide links or direct your community to leave Twitch for another platform on which youâ€™re multistreaming. Lastly, you canâ€™t show combined activity from other platforms or services on Twitch, so showing a Restream.io chat overlay isnâ€™t allowed.</p>

<p>While this new policy allows more flexibility for creators, itâ€™s obviously still subject to some fine print.</p>

<p>This shift reflects Twitchâ€™s acknowledgment of increasing competition from other platforms and the growing demand for greater streaming freedom.</p>

<p>So, despite the apparent loosening of rules, Twitchâ€™s strategy of maintaining control over its platform, while allowing for simulcasting, is a step toward adapting to the evolving streaming landscape.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="update-3-minimum-content-requirements">Update #3: Minimum Content Requirements</h2>

<p>The third update applies to minimum content requirements, which flew a bit under the radar.</p>

<p>Section 2.1 of the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/monetized-streamer-agreement">Monetized Streamer Agreement</a> applies to both Affiliates and Partners, and used to state that they must â€œprovide a consistent amount of live content, program quality live content, regularly interact with and engage viewers of your Twitch Channel, and respond to live viewers of your Twitch Channel via Twitch chat.â€</p>

<p>But what can be considered a consistent amount of content?</p>

<p>As of now, the clause isnâ€™t mentioned in the agreement anymore.</p>

<p>Section 2.1 now only mentions that you agree to â€œgenerally engage with viewers of your Twitch Channel through chat or other live means as applicable.â€</p>

<p>So this type of minimum engagement or interaction requirement isnâ€™t applicable anymore, and itâ€™s weird it was added in the first place as it has never been in the agreement before the June 2023 update.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>

<p>The response from Twitchâ€™s community was overwhelmingly negative. Creators expressed frustration, and Twitch quickly backpedaled, claiming they undid the updates.</p>

<p>However, while their platform exclusivity isnâ€™t really intact anymore, their advertising rules are.</p>

<p>The apology feels empty, and creators remain at the mercy of Twitchâ€™s ever-evolving rules.</p>

<p>Twitch says itâ€™s a creator-focused platform, but the reality paints a different picture. If Twitch were truly creator-friendly, they would stop exploiting the community with constant nit-picky shifts in policy.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="strategic-play">Strategic Play</h2>

<p>The question arises: is this a deliberate strategy?</p>

<p>Itâ€™s entirely possible.</p>

<p>This could be part of a negative marketing strategy designed to provoke strong reactions, generate buzz, and attract more creators to Twitchâ€™s platform. It might even be an attempt to help Twitch become more profitable.</p>

<p>Since Amazon acquired Twitch in 2014, the platform has struggled with profitability.</p>

<p>With rising costs and constant pressure to deliver, Twitch has pushed for more ads, permanent lower sub splits, and introduced several policies that seem geared toward maximizing profit at the expense of creators.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if this isnâ€™t a deliberate move, then Twitch is simply poorly managed.</p>

<p>For the platform to thrive, they would need to change course by prioritizing creators, raising sub splits, cutting down on intrusive ads, and easing restrictions on content-sharing opportunities. Only then could they begin rebuilding the trust theyâ€™ve lost with their community.</p>

<p>However, based on past actions, it seems Twitch is more concerned with the bottom line than with fostering a positive creator experience.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="to-wrap-up">To Wrap Up</h2>

<p>This post provides a summary of Twitchâ€™s recent updates and the ongoing cycle of controversy surrounding them.</p>

<p>If anything, it serves as a reminder that diversifying content platforms and exploring alternatives might be necessary for creators in the long run.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading!</em></p>
