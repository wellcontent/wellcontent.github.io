<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>After you’ve <a href="https://wellcontent.io/best-microphones-for-starting-streamers">selected your microphone</a>, it’s time to get a camera.</p>

<p>A camera lets your viewers see your reactions, and it’s an easy way to set yourself apart from other creators.</p>

<p>However, if you don’t feel comfortable with your face on screen, be aware that you don’t have to get a facecam. There’s no need to listen to streaming ‘gurus’ simply because they tell you to use a facecam.</p>

<p>Do what feels comfortable for <em>you</em>.</p>

<p>If you do wish to use a facecam or you want to experiment with it, look no further.</p>

<p>This guide lists the best webcams to start your livestream. All recommended gear is high quality and under $100, with free options included.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    No matter which camera you choose, white balancing is the most important thing. You can adjust white balance in the camera software.
</div>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="logitech-c270">Logitech C270</h2>

<p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yo4swj-PL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Logitech C270" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;" /></p>

<p>Price range: $25-$40</p>

<p>✔ Very affordable<br />
✔ HD 720p resolution<br />
✔ Compact &amp; portable<br />
❌ Camera quality isn’t high enough for fullscreen camera scenes</p>

<p>The Logitech C270 gives 1280x720 video resolution at 30fps. It’s not recommended for fullscreen camera scenes for this exact reason.</p>

<p>The camera has a very tightly zoomed in field of view, but it’s sufficient for a pure facecam on stream.</p>

<p>It’s completely made out of plastic, including the camera lens.</p>

<p>It doesn’t come with a tripod, but it does have a clip that can rest on your monitor. The webcam can tilt up and down.</p>

<p>This webcam is a decent option if you only want to use a small camera overlay.</p>

<h2 id="droidcam-obs">DroidCam OBS</h2>

<p><img src="https://files.dev47apps.net/img/droidcam_obs_props.png" alt="DroidCam OBS" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;" /></p>

<p>Price: $0-$10</p>

<p>✔ Free<br />
✔ Uses your phone as a camera source<br />
✔ Connects over Wi-Fi or USB<br />
❌ Low quality video resolution</p>

<p>With DroidCam OBS, you can use your phone camera as a facecam. This way, you don’t need to invest extra in a webcam or camera, but you can use the camera that you already have in your pocket!</p>

<p>You can choose to use your phone camera as a replacement for a dedicated camera, or even as a handheld camera on the side.</p>

<p>The Free version of DroidCam OBS limits you to 640x480 upscaled video resolution at 30fps without watermarks. This shouldn’t be too much of an issue if you only use a small facecam screen as an overlay.</p>

<p>You can also choose to use upscaled 1280x720 or 1920x1080 video resolution, and then crop out the watermark.</p>

<p>The Premium version of DroidCam OBS costs $10 (which used to be $5) and gives you 1280x720 video resolution without watermarks. It can supposedly do 60fps, but the forums don’t seem to confirm that.</p>

<p>This premium option is better if you want to use fullscreen camera scenes.</p>

<p>The UI of the app is extremely intuitive, and it connects almost instantaneously.</p>

<p>The first setup can be a bit finicky though, so keep that in mind.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dev47apps.com/obs" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none"> Download DroidCam OBS <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a></p>

<p><br /></p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    Keep your phone on the charger if you plan to use it as a dedicated streaming camera.

<h2 id="vdoninja">VDO.Ninja</h2>

<p><img src="https://guides.vdo.ninja/assets/screenshots/camera-picker.jpg" alt="VDO.Ninja" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;" /></p>

<p>Price: $0</p>

<p>✔ Free &amp; open source<br />
✔ Uses your phone as a camera source<br />
✔ Connects over Wi-Fi with a Browser Source<br />
❌ Random video and audio connectivity issues</p>

<p>There’s no need to invest in an extra camera, because you can use your phone’s native camera.</p>

<p>VDO.Ninja gives you fully adjustable video resolutions and bitrates. So you can set your output to 1280x720p60, 1920x1080p60, or even custom resolutions if you want.</p>

<p>This option is very easy to set up. You add your camera via the VDO.Ninja site and set it as a browser source in OBS. It’s completely free, with no premium offers.</p>

<p>If security is important to you, VDO.Ninja uses no downloads, no data collection, and no sign-ins. Plus all video data is peer-to-peer. Plus the project is open source.</p>

<p>It also offers group scenes, remote screen sharing into OBS, multi-stream monitoring, and more.</p>

<p>There have been some reports of random video and audio connectivity issues, but that shouldn’t happen much.</p>

<p>VDO.Ninja is a perfect option if you want to have a truly free and fully customizable option.</p>

<h2 id="logitech-c920">Logitech C920</h2>

<p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71iNwni9TsL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Logitech C920" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;" /></p>

<p>Price range: $60-$70</p>

<p>✔ Industry standard<br />
✔ Full HD 1080p resolution<br />
✔ Compact &amp; portable<br />
❌ Only 720p at 60fps</p>

<p>The Logitech C920 gives you 1280x720 video resolution in up to 60fps and 1920x1080 video resolution at up to 30fps.</p>

<p>It’s an all-plastic build. Except for the camera lens, which is made of glass.</p>

<p>The quality of the webcam itself is pretty good, and almost identical to the Logitech C922.</p>

<p>It looks to overexpose the subject quite a bit, but you can manually change that in the camera settings.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the Logitech software keeps resetting your input. So you’d have to check and change your settings every time before you start streaming.</p>

<p>This webcam is a good option for both camera overlays and fullscreen camera scenes.</p>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    Make sure to always turn off autofocus. Otherwise you get this flickering/blurring effect on stream, which can be very distracting.

<p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712xpaJPT6L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Logitech C922" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;" /></p>

<p>Price range: $80-$100</p>

<p>✔ Industry standard<br />
✔ Full HD 1080p resolution<br />
✔ Compact &amp; portable<br />
❌ Only 720p at 60fps</p>

<p>The Logitech C922 gives you 720p at up to 60fps and 1080p at up to 30fps video resolution.</p>

<p>It’s an all-plastic build. But it has a glass camera lens and looks very sleek.</p>

<p>The color balance looks decent out of the box and it handles low light situations very well.</p>

<p>It comes with a mounting system that you can clip to the top of your monitor, and a tripod mount on the bottom for the included desktop tripod.</p>

<p>The C922 is overall cleaner image than the C920 and doesn’t overcompensate in low light as much.</p>

<p>This webcam is a great option for both camera overlays and fullscreen camera scenes. But if you have a tighter budget, go with the Logitech C920 instead.</p>

<p><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zTLsSWngL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Razer Kiyo" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;" /></p>

<p>Price range: $70-$100</p>

<p>✔ Full HD resolution<br />
✔ Built-in ring light<br />
✔ Compact &amp; portable<br />
❌ Reported hardware/software issues</p>

<p>The Razer Kiyo gives you 1280x720 video resolution at up to 60fps and 1920x1080 video resolution at up to 30 fps.</p>

<p>It has good color balance and light balance out of the box compared to the Logitech C920 and C922. It does show more yellow tones and a bit more saturation.</p>

<p>It has a built-in key light, so there’s not really a need to invest in extra key lighting.</p>

<p>But do make sure that you have another lamp somewhere around you to avoid losing image quality and framerate with only one light source.</p>

<p>You can adjust the ring light brightness, but not the temperature.</p>

<p>The Kiyo is a nice option if you want a webcam that offers built-in lighting.</p>

<p>Price range: $45-$60</p>

<p>✔ Full HD 1080p resolution<br />
✔ Privacy shutter<br />
✔ Very compact<br />
❌ Doesn’t do as well in low light</p>

<p>The AVerMedia Live Streamer CAM 313 gives you 1920x1080 video resolution at up to 30fps.</p>

<p>The image quality is very clear and it does a great job at capturing natural lighting.</p>

<p>It comes with a flexible clamp that you can rest on your monitor plus a tripod mount for you to connect it to a desktop tripod. You can turn the camera itself a full 360 degrees, which is a nice feature to get more precise positioning.</p>

<p>It even has a privacy shutter to keep out any unwanted guests.</p>

<p>The build quality looks sturdy, with a glass camera lens and a sleek, black tube-like design.</p>

<p>There’s no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a camera or webcam. Affordable options are available to get you started with streaming.</p>

<p>I hope this guide has helped you.</p>

<p>Let me know if I missed any quality webcams under $100.</p>

<p>In any case, make sure to <a href="https://wellcontent.io/best-microphones-for-starting-streamers">have a quality microphone</a> before getting a webcam.</p>
