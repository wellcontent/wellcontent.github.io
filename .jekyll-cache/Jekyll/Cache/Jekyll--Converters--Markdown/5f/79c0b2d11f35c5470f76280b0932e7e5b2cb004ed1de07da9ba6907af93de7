<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>It seems to be a cycle at this point. They push an update, get backlash, apologize, retract their update, and do the same thing over again.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs go over what the updates actually entail, and then see how this plays into Twitch‚Äôs strategy.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="update-1-advertisements">Update #1: Advertisements</h2>

<p>The first update applies to advertisements.</p>

<p>Burn-in ads and audio are now not allowed. These include embedded advertisements and banner ads.</p>

<p>The reason they made these changes is because they‚Äôre trying to get brands to directly work with Twitch. And they want more control over the events ecosystem and major productions displayed on Twitch, so they can take the deal and cut.</p>

<p>They‚Äôve done this with Esports events in the past, so this isn‚Äôt entirely new.</p>

<p>By forcing brands to work directly with them, Twitch is also pushing talent agencies out of the equation by running through their own sales team.</p>

<p>But Twitch isn‚Äôt able to handle this task themselves, because they‚Äôre already unprofitable and bleeding employees with all the Amazon layoffs.</p>

<p>This will also destroy this particular source of income for smaller creators, limiting creators‚Äô ability to deliver on-screen advertising. Creators and sponsors have built this way of advertising into the creator economy, so limiting it hurts creators directly.</p>

<p>The policy said that burn-in ads (like branded sponsorship codes or logos) shouldn‚Äôt take up more than 3% of the full stream screen. That‚Äôs 332x187 pixels on a 1920x1080 resolution stream.</p>

<p>As of now, creators have until July 1st to make changes necessary to comply with this rule or they risk breaking their contract.</p>

<p>But do you really think Twitch has the capacity to enforce this policy?</p>

<p>They‚Äôd have to go by every streamer individually (there are over 1 million streamers per month) to check if their branded content is taking up less than 3% of their screen.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="update-2-simulcasting">Update #2: Simulcasting</h2>

<p>The second update applies to simulcasting.</p>

<p>Simulcasting, or multistreaming, is where you stream to multiple platforms at the same time. You are allowed to multistream to mobile-first competitors like Instagram and TikTok. And it was already not allowed for Affiliates and Partners to stream to other direct competitors like YouTube and Facebook.</p>

<p>But now Twitch has the audacity to apply this rule to <em>anyone</em> using their service. Basically binding you to their platform, whether you have a contract with them or not.</p>

<p>This update is honestly bogus. Twitch is extremely arrogant to believe tying all creators to their platform is the way forward.</p>

<p>Besides, Twitch wouldn‚Äôt know that you‚Äôre multistreaming to other platforms. You‚Äôd probably get a warning if you‚Äôre caught. Under 5000 CCV, you‚Äôre not likely to get reprimanded though. They‚Äôve never enforced this rule and it doesn‚Äôt look like they care if you multistream.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="update-3-minimum-content-requirements">Update #3: Minimum Content Requirements</h2>

<p>The third update applies to minimum content requirements, which flew a bit under the radar.</p>

<p>Section 2.1 of the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/monetized-streamer-agreement">Monetized Streamer Agreement</a> applies to both Affiliates and Partners, and stated that they must ‚Äúprovide a consistent amount of live content, program quality live content, regularly interact with and engage viewers of your Twitch Channel, and respond to live viewers of your Twitch Channel via Twitch chat.‚Äù</p>

<p>This type of minimum engagement or interaction requirement hasn‚Äôt been in the agreement before, and the sentence looks to be vaguely worded on purpose.</p>

<p>What does ‚Äúa consistent amount‚Äù mean? There‚Äôs no mention of quality requirements, amount of hours put in, or any measure of engagement.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs up to Twitch to decide, at any moment in time. If they think you‚Äôre not providing enough quality content or on a consistent enough basis, you could get kicked out of the Affiliate or Partner program.</p>

<p>As of now, the clause isn‚Äôt mentioned in the agreement anymore.</p>

<p>Section 2.1 now only mentions that you agree to ‚Äúprovide a consistent amount of live content, program quality live content, regularly interact with and engage viewers of your Twitch Channel, and respond to live viewers of your Twitch Channel via Twitch chat.‚Äù</p>

<p>So it looks like they‚Äôve slightly changed the wording, but still vague enough to work in Twitch‚Äôs favor.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>

<p>After Twitch released these updates on Twitter, the community got outraged. And rightfully so.</p>

<p>With the backlash, Twitch back pedaled fast and said they undid their update.</p>

<p>However, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/#11-simulcasting">Section 11 of their Terms of Service</a> states that ‚Äú[w]hen you are streaming live on the Twitch Services you may not simultaneously live stream or broadcast (‚ÄúSimulcast‚Äù) on any other ‚ÄúTwitch-like Service,‚Äù meaning any web-based network, platform, or service that supports live streaming of user generated content.‚Äù</p>

<p>And <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service/#12-advertisements">Section 12 of their Terms of Service</a> states that ‚Äú[t]hird-party advertising networks are not allowed to serve advertising through the Twitch Services‚Äù, which can mean to include embedded advertisements or banner ads.</p>

<p>So their platform exclusivity and advertising rules are still intact. It‚Äôs only an empty apology from them.</p>

<p>But Twitch is a creator-focused platform? Sure.</p>

<p>They don‚Äôt care.</p>

<p>Now. Creators, Twitch is like an abusive relationship at this point.</p>

<p>Doing harm, apologizing, then doing harm all over again. And the cycle continues. When do you say enough is enough? When do you stop being willingly gaslit?</p>

<p>They‚Äôve been showing their true predatory character this entire time. Believe them when they do.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="strategic-play">Strategic Play</h2>

<p>The question here is: could this be done on purpose?</p>

<p>Yes. It definitely feels like it.</p>

<p>It might be part of a negative marketing strategy to get their name out there again and to get more eyeballs and creators on the platform. In any case, it could be a way to hopefully make Twitch profitable.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that Twitch has never been profitable.</p>

<p>As the saying goes, ‚Äúall publicity is good publicity‚Äù. Even if it‚Äôs negative.</p>

<p>So this perspective would tie in with the changes you‚Äôve been seeing on the platform ever since Amazon acquired Twitch back in 2014. Amazon is likely doing everything it can to make Twitch make money. Which is why you see so many ad pushes, permanent low sub splits, and overall greediness on the platform. Including these new updates.</p>

<p>But what if it isn‚Äôt on purpose?</p>

<p>Well, then Twitch has a very out of touch management.</p>

<p>Twitch, and especially Amazon, would ironically have to go in a different direction. They‚Äôd need to see that squeezing their creators and community dry isn‚Äôt the way to become profitable.</p>

<p>They‚Äôd have to actually put creators first and take the initial hit of upping the sub splits and lowering ad density. Plus they‚Äôd have to take away platform exclusivity and stop taking away monetization opportunities for its creators.</p>

<p>This is the only way to make creators want to use and trust the platform they‚Äôre creating on.</p>

<p>Because frankly, Twitch has lost the trust from its community.</p>

<p>But they probably don‚Äôt care.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="to-wrap-up">To Wrap Up</h2>

<p>I hope this gave you a good summary of the changes incoming and the pattern that Twitch is following.</p>

<p>Maybe it‚Äôll even get you to change platforms or diversify your content in the future. Hopefully sooner rather than later.</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading!</em></p>
