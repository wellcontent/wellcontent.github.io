I"	<h2 id="hi-im-chloe">Hi, Iâ€™m Chloe!</h2>

<p>Iâ€™m the person behind <strong>Well&amp;Content</strong>. I began creating content on <a href="https://twitch.tv/glitchedinorbit">Twitch</a> in 2016 and on <a href="https://youtube.com/glitchedinorbit">YouTube</a> in 2020. Well&amp;Content is a resource hub to help neurodivergent creators thrive in their creative journey.</p>

<h3 id="my-mission">My Mission</h3>

<p>I aim to support neurodivergent creators like you with actionable guides, customizable templates, and insightful posts that focus on mental, physical, digital, and financial well-being.</p>

<h3 id="my-story">My Story</h3>

<p>My journey has been shaped by my experiences and recovery from <strong>an eating disorder (ED)</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>, and <strong>depression</strong>, as well as ongoing <strong>chronic pain</strong> and <strong>chronic fatigue</strong>. Recently, Iâ€™ve also been diagnosed with <strong>ADHD</strong>, which has helped me better understand my creative process and the unique challenges that come with it.</p>

<p>Burnout from content creation, alongside my mental health struggles, led me to prioritize my well-being and start Well&amp;Content. I want to share the tools, insights, and support that have helped me navigate my neurodivergent journey, so that you can thrive creatively and sustainably.</p>
