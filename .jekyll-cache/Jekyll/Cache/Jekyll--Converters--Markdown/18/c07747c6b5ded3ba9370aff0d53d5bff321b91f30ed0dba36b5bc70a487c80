<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>As a creator, the pressure to be â€˜onâ€™ all the time can become overwhelming. This can make it difficult to set boundaries and truly take time for yourself.</p>

<p>This guide will give you some actionable tips to take control over your mental wellbeing in the digital space.</p>

<p>All tips are taken from research and personal experience.</p>

<p>Take a deep breath. Letâ€™s hop in.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="1-do-what-you-love">1. Do What You Love</h2>

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>I know it sounds cheesy to start off with this, but hear me out.</p>

<p>Content creation isnâ€™t a â€˜get-rich-quickâ€™ scheme. You have to be in it for the long haul.</p>

<p>If you do not pursue what you love or at least enjoy doing, you will eventually burn out. Otherwise, what youâ€™re doing isnâ€™t aligned with your strengths, values, and true self.</p>

<p>Thus, you need to create content in the field that you love.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a Japanese concept called <em>ikigai</em>. This is your â€˜purpose in lifeâ€™ or â€˜reason to liveâ€™, so to speak.</p>

<p>The Western interpretation, especially in HÃ©ctor GarcÃ­aâ€™s <a href="https://amzn.to/3v07skt" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</a>, is more specific. It encapsulates ikigai as what you love, what youâ€™re good at, what you can be paid for, and what the world needs.</p>

<p>In essence, you found your ikigai if you can find pleasure and satisfaction in what you do and youâ€™re good at it.</p>

<p>But, while the book is a good read, your ikigai doesnâ€™t need to entail a combination or any of these four things per se.</p>

<p>I can highly recommend two books for an authentic Japanese perspective on ikigai. Namely, <a href="https://amzn.to/3v1cz3G" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ikigai: The Japanese Art of a Meaningful Life</a> by Yukari Mitsuhashi and <a href="https://amzn.to/3uZyicl" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Little Book of Ikigai</a> by Ken Mogi.</p>

<p>According to Mogi and Mitsuhashi, you can find your ikigai in a wide range of conditions.</p>

<p>Research has indicated that you are less likely to experience depression and more likely to measure well-being if you have a sense of ikigai. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11469-019-00150-w" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[1]</sup></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.11236/jph.59.7_433" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[2]</sup></a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-022-00764-7" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p>Invest time in discovering your ikigai.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t let others decide for you what you should do. Your content creation journey comes from where your passions and goals lie.</p>

<p>For example, I love entertaining others, writing and doing academic research, and sharing my experience. Plus, mental health is very important to me. Hence this blog.</p>

<p>This might not be the field where you want to create content in, and thatâ€™s okay. Content creation looks different for everyone.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, make sure to provide value to your audience.</p>

<p>You can provide value in different ways, be it educational, entertaining, or otherwise. You need to find what <em>you</em> value and what you wish to share with the world.</p>

<p>Only you can decide what you love doing.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="2-compare-yourself-to-yourself-only">2. Compare Yourself To Yourself Only</h2>

<p>Itâ€™s very easy to get caught up in comparing yourself to others. Itâ€™s happened to me. I would compare myself to other content creators, which lowered the confidence in my abilities.</p>

<p>Worse, it would negatively impact the quality of my own content.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d keep overthinking and worrying about what others were creating and how I compared. Eventually, this negative spiral led to burnout.</p>

<p>This is how I got out of the negative comparison spiral:</p>

<p>Focus on what <em>you</em> want to contribute to the world and what you enjoy doing.</p>

<p>Remind yourself that someone elseâ€™s success isnâ€™t your failure. Look at the progress <em>you</em> have made over the past few days, weeks, or even years.</p>

<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
    âSomeone else's success isn't your failure.â
</div>

<p>Itâ€™s easy to forget how far youâ€™ve come, but you can always make time to evaluate.</p>

<p>In the end, you can only compare yourself to yourself, and grow from what you have done and learned the day(s) before.</p>

<p>Success means something different for everyone.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="3-diversify-your-content">3. Diversify Your Content</h2>

<p>When it comes to any type of content creation, exposure is very important.</p>

<p>You want to get your content out there for others to see. Iâ€™d assume you do. Otherwise, why are you creating content?</p>

<p>By diversifying your content, you avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. This includes the type of content you create, but also the platform youâ€™re on. Otherwise, you can expect diminishing returns.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve learned this the hard way.</p>

<p>You risk limiting your exposure by only staying on one platform or by only creating one form of content.</p>

<p>That said, you have to find the best content creation platform that works for you and your needs. The same goes for the content itself.</p>

<p>However, do keep balance with diversifying. Every additional platform is extra work. Itâ€™s best to stick to 2-4 main platforms.</p>

<p>For example, I currently like to curate content for YouTube, livestream on Twitch, and post on Twitter.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="4-generate-streams-of-passive-income">4. Generate Streams Of Passive Income</h2>

<p>Passive income is an amazing way to generate income even when youâ€™re not actively working.</p>

<p>This takes the load off of having to be â€˜onâ€™ as a creator at all times.</p>

<p>For example, I get income through YouTube ads, Twitch subscriptions, and Ko-fi tips. Now I also have this blog, which includes affiliate links and (non-intrusive) ads in the future.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which you can generate passive income.</p>

<p>They donâ€™t all have to take up a lot of time either.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="passive-income-ideas">Passive income ideas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>create an online course</li>
  <li>write an e-book</li>
  <li>start a blog (like me!)</li>
  <li>upload content to YouTube</li>
  <li>create an app</li>
  <li>sell merchandise</li>
  <li>get sponsorships</li>
  <li>affiliate marketing</li>
  <li>ad placement</li>
  <li>subscriptions</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>This idea list is non-exhaustive, and there are many other ways to generate passive income.</p>

<p>Get creative!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="5-take-good-care-of-yourself">5. Take Good Care Of Yourself</h2>

<p>As with all things in life, your endeavors need balance. You have to take care of yourself before you can take care of others - or work-related endeavors.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re also more efficient and productive if you take care of yourself. Plus, you can create higher quality content.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a win-win for everyone.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="self-care-ideas">Self care ideas</h3>

<ul>
  <li>find a daily routine that works for you</li>
  <li>prioritize sleep hygiene and a night-time routine</li>
  <li>stay hydrated</li>
  <li>feed your body and soul with nourishing foods</li>
  <li>schedule breaks (I still struggle with this) - set alarms or use the Pomodoro Method</li>
  <li>find ways to decompress, if only for 5 minutes - journal, meditate, exercise, read a book, take a walk in nature, take a hot bath/shower, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Additionally, find ways to manage your energy.</p>

<p>I like to use <a href="https://butyoudontlooksick.com/articles/written-by-christine/the-spoon-theory" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spoon Theory</a>, coined by Christine Miserandino.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a metaphor to describe the amount of energy someone has available for daily tasks. This energy can be physical or mental.</p>

<p>Not everyone has the same amount of energy available. People with a disability, chronic illness, or mental health issues may have less energy to begin with. Compare that to someone who doesnâ€™t have to cope with anything like this.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important to know how much energy you have in a day, and how to manage your energy to get tasks done.</p>

<p>It might look something like this.</p>

<p>Energy regenerates after a nap or a cup of tea, but depletes after spending time in a group of people or doing chores.</p>

<p>For me, itâ€™s been very helpful to make a list of what gives me energy and what drains my energy.</p>

<p>I challenge you to make a list like this as well. If you need any inspiration, think of what you used to love doing as a kid.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="6-do-not-focus-on-metrics">6. Do Not Focus On Metrics</h2>

<p>Worrying about and overanalyzing metrics led me to burnout on numbers.</p>

<p>I felt like I was never doing well or good enough.</p>

<p>As a content creator itâ€™s easy to become fixated on numbers. Especially as a streamer on Twitch, because you get access to them after every broadcast. They can immediately impact your mood if you let them.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d check my streaming analytics after streams to â€˜analyzeâ€™ how I did, but Iâ€™d always feel deflated.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that numbers fluctuate, especially during livestreams.</p>

<p>Low(er) viewer count does not, I repeat DOES NOT, necessarily mean you put out bad content. People hop in and out of streams, people go outside, real life happensâ€¦</p>

<p>You might also not be discoverable enough. In this case, lack of proper discoverability on the platform itself plays a big role.</p>

<p>Do NOT make the mistake of equating numbers with success or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that thereâ€™s always a person behind the number. Donâ€™t lose track of that.</p>

<p>Do occasionally review your metrics.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is to review them over a 30 day, 60 day, or 90 day period. This gives you a good reference point for how you performed, and whether you need to pivot or not.</p>

<p>For livestreams specifically, 90 days gives the most accurate depiction of performance.</p>

<p>Instead of worrying about numbers, get creative and elevate the content you have to offer. Test out new concepts, optimize SEO, work on self-growth, etc.</p>

<p>Review your metrics only every once in a while instead of multiple times per week.</p>

<p>Take back a healthier headspace.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="7-create-the-workflow-that-works-for-you">7. Create The Workflow That Works For You</h2>

<p>There are many ways in which you can create a workflow specialized for you.</p>

<p>Examples could be setting â€˜office hoursâ€™ to manage your time, creating a to-do list, or setting deadlines for yourself.</p>

<p><a href="https://amzn.to/38y9DCR" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Achieving More with Less</a> by Richard Koch has had a great impact on my workflow.</p>

<p>It entails that 20% percent of your time accounts for 80% of results. Vice versa, sometimes 80% of the time you spend accounts for only 20% of results.</p>

<p>Greg McKeownâ€™s <a href="https://amzn.to/3vR6sOL" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</a> provided a similar insight.</p>

<p>You can increase your effectiveness simply by identifying what youâ€™re wasting time on and what you should be focusing on instead.</p>

<p>In other words, focus on that which is <em>absolutely essential</em> - or on the 20% that brings 80% of results.</p>

<p>I started combining the 80/20 Principle and Essentialism.</p>

<p>Maybe this works for you too.</p>

<p>It has also helped me to make use of templates or pre-made assets to take the load off of having to start from scratch every single time.</p>

<p>You can look into <a href="https://ko-fi.com/explore" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ko-fi</a>, <a href="https://go.fiverr.com/visit/?bta=405967&amp;brand=fiverrcpa" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiverr</a>, or <a href="https://etsy.com" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Etsy</a> for this.</p>

<p>Whatever you do, itâ€™s important to adapt a workflow to your needs specifically.</p>

<p>If you need to schedule an afternoon nap to recharge and get your creative juices flowing, do it!</p>

<p>If you need to break larger projects into smaller tasks, do it!</p>

<p>Everyone is different and no one works in the same way.</p>

<p><br /></p>
