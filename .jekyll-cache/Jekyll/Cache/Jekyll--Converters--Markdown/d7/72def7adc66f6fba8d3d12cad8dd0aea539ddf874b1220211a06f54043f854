I"·	<p><em>Welcome to Well&amp;Content! Prepare for creator insights and life lessons, with a focus on wellbeing in the online space.</em></p>

<p>My nameâ€™s Chloe, and Iâ€™m the person behind Well&amp;Content.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve spent <strong>5+ years creating content</strong> on the livestreaming platform <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/what-is-twitch/">Twitch</a>. I also started creating on YouTube quite recently.</p>

<p>Even though I enjoy entertaining, I wanted to do <strong>more than that</strong>.</p>

<p>I have a bachelorâ€™s degree in Liberal Arts, and a masterâ€™s degree in International Law. Because of this, I have a background in academic and legal writing.</p>

<p>My passions include writing, academic research, mental wellbeing, and of course content creation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Itâ€™s time for me to share my personal experience.</em></strong></p>

<p>I want to give you an <strong>insight into content creation</strong> in general, with a focus on mindfulness and wellbeing.</p>

<p>On this blog, youâ€™ll find <strong>tips</strong> on what to do and what to avoid as a streamer and content creator. It will have <strong>researched information</strong> to help you with your wellbeing in the online space. Iâ€™ll also document what Iâ€™ve learned in <strong>my journey</strong> as a content creator.</p>

<p>Transparency, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intersectionality">intersectionality</a>, and a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/multidisciplinary">multidisciplinary</a> approach are very important to me. Academic research will be a part of the writing process for most articles.</p>

<p>The plan is to focus on <strong>creator wellbeing</strong>, and to include <strong>guides</strong> and <strong>product reviews</strong> down the line. Iâ€™d also like to expand my articles to content consumers, with articles on <strong>mental health</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to become a content creator, or are already a content creator, youâ€™ll likely find value on this blog.</p>

<p>This is my <strong>first ever blog</strong>, and Iâ€™m excited to share my experience and story with you. I hope youâ€™ll come along for the ride.</p>

<p>I hope youâ€™re as excited as I am.</p>
