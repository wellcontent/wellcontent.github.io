## Hi, I'm Chloe!

I'm the person behind **Well&Content**. I began creating content on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/glitchedinorbit) in 2016 and on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/glitchedinorbit) in 2020. Well&Content is a resource hub to help streamers and content creators enhance their productivity and well-being.

### My Mission

I aim to support creators like you with actionable guides, customizable templates, and insightful posts to help you thrive in your journey—mentally, digitally, physically, and financially.

### My Story

Burnout from streaming led me to prioritize my mental health and start this project, fueled by my passion for mental health and content creation. My mission is to share insights and resources to help you care for your physical, mental, digital, and financial well-being.

### What I Offer

- **Templates**: Streamline your workflow with tools like the Notion Creator Dashboard and Income & Expense Tracker.
- **Guides**: Resources like OBS Studio 101 to support your growth.
- **Posts**: Articles on content creation, streaming tips, and mental health.
