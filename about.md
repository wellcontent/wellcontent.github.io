Hi. I'm Chloe, the person behind Well&Content!

I've been creating content on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/glitchedinorbit) since 2016 and on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/glitchedinorbit) since 2020.

Along the way, I slowly started burning out from streaming. So I needed to put my mental health first and focus on different projects.

This is how this blog came about. And also because of my passion for mental health and content creation.

I wanted to share my content creation experience and streamer insights with you, to help you take care of your physical, mental, digital, and financial wellbeing. By providing you with actionable guides and resources.

Feel free to join me on my journey.
