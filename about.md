Hi. I'm Chloe, the person behind Well&Content!

This blog came about because of my passion for mental health and content creation.

I've been creating content on [Twitch](twitch.tv/glitchedinorbit) since 2016 and on [YouTube](youtube.com/glitchedinorbit) since 2020.

I've also recovered from **chronic depression** and an **eating disorder**. Through lots of therapy and self-love. (Although I do still slip up sometimes.)

**Writing** and **academic research** are part of my background. I have a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and a master's degree in International Law.

So I wanted to combine those skills with my love for content creation to share my story, experience, and insights with you.

**Want to get in touch?**

Send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/glitchedinorbit) or via [email](mailto:info.wellcontent@gmail.com) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!

I'd love to connect with you.
