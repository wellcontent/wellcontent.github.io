## Hi, I'm Chloe!

I'm the person behind **Well&Content**. I began creating content on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/glitchedinorbit) in 2016 and on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/glitchedinorbit) in 2020. Well&Content is a resource hub to help neurodivergent creators thrive in their creative journey.

### My Mission

I aim to support neurodivergent creators like you with actionable guides, customizable templates, and insightful posts that focus on mental, physical, digital, and financial well-being.

### My Story

My journey has been shaped by my experiences and recovery from **an eating disorder (ED)**, **anxiety**, and **depression**, as well as ongoing **chronic pain** and **chronic fatigue**. Recently, I've also been diagnosed with **ADHD**, which has helped me better understand my creative process and the unique challenges that come with it.

Burnout from content creation, alongside my mental health struggles, led me to prioritize my well-being and start Well&Content. I want to share the tools, insights, and support that have helped me navigate my neurodivergent journey, so that you can thrive creatively and sustainably.

### What I Offer

- **[Templates](https://wellcontent.io/templates)**: Streamline your workflow with tools like the Notion Creator Dashboard and Income & Expense Tracker.
- **[Guides](https://wellcontent.io/guides)**: Resources like OBS Studio 101 to support your growth.
- **[Posts](https://wellcontent.io/blog)**: Articles on content creation, streaming tips, and mental health.
