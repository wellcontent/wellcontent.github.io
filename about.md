Hi. I'm Chloe, the person behind Well&Content!



I've been creating content on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/glitchedinorbit) since 2016 and on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/glitchedinorbit) since 2020.

Along the way, I slowly started burning out from streaming. So I needed to put my mental health first and focus on different projects.

This is how this blog came about. And also because of my passion for mental health and content creation.

I've recovered from chronic depression and an eating disorder. Through lots of therapy and self-love. (Although I do still slip up sometimes.)

Writing and academic research are part of my background. I have a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts and a master's degree in International Law.

So I wanted to combine those skills with my love for content creation to share my story, experience, and insights with you.

Feel free to join me on my journey.
