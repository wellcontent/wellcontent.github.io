## Introduction

Audio is the **most important factor** in a livestream. It's even a standard in the FILM industry that audio is more important than video. That's because it makes up the majority of the experience of those who consume the movie.

You cannot mask bad audio in post-processing. If you have bad input, the damage is already done. You CAN enhance great audio in post. But that's not possible if you're streaming live content.

So instead, aim for getting good sounding audio from the get-go. I swear, it's possible to do so with affordable options.

This guide lists the best microphones to start your livestream. All recommended gear is high quality and $100 maximum.

While I don't personally own all of the equipment featured in this list, I do know what I need to look for in equipment because I have over 5 years of streaming experience and over 6 years of content creation experience.

Expect to see only quality recommendations here. The aim was to find a balance between price and quality of the product.

Let's get into it.

<br>

## Terminology

Before I list the best microphones under $100, it's important to go over some common terminology for audio. Terms often used are **polar pattern**, **frequency response**, and **sample rate**.

If you already know about these terms, you can [skip to the next section](#condenser-microphones).

<br>

### Polar pattern

Polar patterns are the areas around the microphone where it picks up sound. Some common ones include cardioid, supercardioid, and omnidirectional.

A **cardioid** polar pattern is the most common pattern you'll find. It picks up most sound from the front of the mic and a little from the sides. This makes it a solid choice for streamers, because it'll highlight the source (the streamer) in front of it.

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="https://blog.andertons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Cardioid-768x768.png" alt="Cardioid polar pattern visualization" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 30rem;">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Cardioid polar pattern visualization from <a href="https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/microphone-polar-patterns-explained" class="text-muted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline">Andertons</a></figcaption>
</figure>

A **supercardioid** polar pattern has a narrower pickup area compared to the regular cardioid pattern. And it'll pick up most sound from the source in front of it. But this pattern rejects more unwanted background noise, which makes it perfect for anyone in a loud environment.

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="https://blog.andertons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Supercardioid-.png" alt="Supercardioid polar pattern visualization" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 30rem;">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Supercardioid polar pattern visualization from <a href="https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/microphone-polar-patterns-explained" class="text-muted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline">Andertons</a></figcaption>
</figure>

An **omnidirectional** polar pattern picks up sound equally all around the microphone. This is great for picking up acoustics and instruments, but not so much for live streaming. Because it picks up sound all around it, there's no easy way for you to get rid of potential keyboard and mouse sounds. If you have a Blue Yeti for streaming, make sure your microphone isn't set to this polar pattern.

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="https://blog.andertons.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/omni-768x768.png" alt="Omnidirectional polar pattern visualization" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 30rem;">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Omnidirectional polar pattern visualization from <a href="https://blog.andertons.co.uk/learn/microphone-polar-patterns-explained" class="text-muted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline">Andertons</a></figcaption>

<br>

### Frequency response

Frequency response is the range of sound that a microphone can reproduce and how its output varies within that range. A response curve graphically represents the frequency response of a microphone.

<figure class="figure">
    <img src="https://content-files.shure.com/OriginFiles/BlogPosts/mic-basics-frequency-response/images/mic-basics-frequency-response_content-1.png" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 30rem;">
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">Response curve visualization from <a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/performance-production/louder/mic-basics-frequency-response" class="text-muted" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: underline">Shure</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Mid Range (500-3000 Hz) is the range where the human ear is most sensitive to the smallest details.

Presence (3000-7000 Hz) is the range for sound definition and good sound intelligibility. It's also the area of many speech consonants.

Be aware that measurement equipment and an anechoic chamber (a specially constructed room for controlled audio testing) for reliable frequency response charts are quite an investment. So these charts can be helpful, but published charts can also be unreliable or simply wishful thinking. Especially with unreputable companies and with lower end products.

<br>

### Sample rate

Sample rate is simply the rate at which audio is converted. The most common rate is 44.1 kHz or 16 bit. But the standard in professional audio contexts such as audio for video is 48 kHz or 24 bit. Sound with 48 kHz is a closer recreation of the original audio source, so it sounds more natural. And the extra headroom is nice to have to avoid clipping.

<br>

## Condenser Microphones

Condenser microphones are very sensitive to sound, so you can get away with positioning them further from you without losing too much of your voice on stream. They are a great choice for any streamer.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    Definitely use the built-in Noise Suppression audio filter in OBS if you go with a condenser microphone.

<br>

### Blue Snowball iCE

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71V4ytRfB0L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Blue Snowball iCE" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;">

Price range: $40-$50

✔ Compact & plug 'n play  
✔ Cute design  
✔ Affordable  
❌ Easily picks up thudding  



The Blue Snowball iCE has a cardioid polar pattern and a frequency response of 40Hz to 18,000 Hz. Its sample rate is 44.1 kHz.

The Snowball iCE connects via USB directly into your PC, so it's virtually plug and play.

It can tilt up and down. And it's very compact, which makes it easy to take with you on the go if needed.

The Snowball iCE is a great value for money with a great price–to-performance ratio.

Plus, you're getting a product from Blue Microphones, a company that has been designing and producing recording equipment since 1995. They know what they're doing.

<!-- (The reason I'm not recommending the Blue Yeti here is because the Yeti is 2x the price of the Snowball iCE. I've also personally had audio crackling issues with the Yeti after about 2 years of use, whereas the Snowball iCE hasn't shown any issues after almost 3 years of use. The Yeti also has these extra polar patterns that are useless to the vast majority of streamers. So it's not worth paying the current price tag for.) -->

✔ Compact & plug 'n play  
✔ Cute design  
✔ Physical mute button  
❌ Can be a bit pricey for cheap build feel  

The Blue Yeti Nano has cardioid and omnidirectional polar patterns and a frequency response of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Its sample rate is 41kHz and 48kHz.

It has a headphone jack for zero latency monitoring, and a physical mute button. The mute button can come in handy, if you like to be able to mute your mic with physical buttons instead of with software.

While the body may feel a bit cheap, it does have a sturdy metal grille.

The microphone can be mounted to a tripod or a mic stand, because it comes with 3/4'' threading and an adapter.

### Razer Seiren Mini

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YZnYlPi+L._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Razer Seiren Mini" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;">

Price range: $35-$50

✔ Compact & cute design  
✔ Affordable  
✔ Plug 'n play  
❌ No physical mute button  

The Razer Seiren Mini has a supercardioid polar pattern and a frequency response of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Its sample rate is up to 48 kHz.

The audio tone is very crisp and clear. It has a small form factor, so it's nice if you don't want a microphone right in your face. But if you do decide to show it off, its cute design will brighten anyone's day.

The build quality of the body does feel a bit cheap because it's made out of plastic. But the grille around the capsule is sturdy metal.

The Seiren Mini also has no physical mute button, nor a headphone jack for zero latency monitoring.

A physical mute button is very handy for streaming, because it allows you to mute your microphone without using any hotkeys or software. However, it isn't a dealbreaker if you don't mind using hotkeys or software to mute your audio input.

In general, the Razer Seiren Mini has a great price-to-performance ratio and is very affordable for the sound quality you're getting.

### Elgato Wave:1

<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7138SUoTVeL._AC_SL1500_.jpg" alt="Elgato Wave:1" class="img-thumbnail" style="max-width: 20rem;">

Price range: $80-$100

✔ Uses Lewitt audio technology  
✔ Compact & plug 'n play  
✔ Comes with audio mixing software  
❌ May sound slightly 'tinny'  

The Elgato Wave:1 has a cardioid polar pattern and a frequency response of 70 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Its sample rate is 48 kHz.

It has a sleek design and it's very compact. Its body is made of plastic and can feel a bit cheap, but it does have a metal mesh grille with a little bit of give to it.

It comes with a headphone jack on the bottom for zero latency monitoring, plus a physical push to mute button on the front. A dial on the front also controls headphone audio. 

The capsule inside the Wave:1 is from Lewitt, an audio technology company that has been around since 2009.

It comes with a 3/4" thread for the included stand, plus an adapter to put it on a mic stand. It also comes with audio mixing software from Elgato, although you can use plugins in OBS instead to do that natively without needing an extra app.

A very interesting feature that's built in is Clipguard, which detects when your voice is too loud (when screaming) and reroutes sound through a second signal path that runs at a lower volume. In short, it doesn't clip or distort your audio when you get loud. An alternative method is to put a Limiter filter on your microphone source in OBS, so your audio doesn't clip when you get loud.

You can also use an Elgato Stream Deck for control over the mic, although this feature isn't specific to the Wave - you can do that with other microphones too.

<a href="https://amzn.to/38nzTAq" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration: none"> Get the Elgato Wave:1 <i class="bi bi-box-arrow-up-right"></i></a>

<div class="alert alert-primary d-flex align-items-top" role="alert">
    Place your microphone at a 45 degree angle towards your mouth, so you're not right in front of it. This prevents air (and spit) hitting the capsule, and limits plosives/popping from coming through in the audio.

<br>

## Dynamic Microphones

If you record or stream in an environment with a lot of ambient noise and you need to filter out those sounds, a dynamic microphone might be for you.

They are a lot less sensitive than condenser microphones, but they do need to be in your face for it to pick up your voice.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  No matter your microphone, definitely add VST audio filters to your source in OBS. Specifically Gain, Noise Suppression, Limiter, and Noise Gate.
