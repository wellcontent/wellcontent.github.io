*Welcome to Well&Content! Prepare for creator insights and life lessons, with a focus on wellbeing in the online space.*

My name's Chloe, and I'm the person behind Well&Content.

I've spent **5+ years creating content** on the livestreaming platform [Twitch](https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/what-is-twitch/). I also started creating on YouTube quite recently.

Even though I enjoy entertaining, I wanted to do **more than that**.

I have a bachelor's degree in Liberal Arts, and a master's degree in International Law. Because of this, I have a background in academic and legal writing.

My passions include writing, academic research, mental wellbeing, and of course content creation.

***It's time for me to share my personal experience.***

I want to give you an **insight into content creation** in general, with a focus on mindfulness and wellbeing.

On this blog, you'll find **tips** on what to do and what to avoid as a streamer and content creator. It will have **researched information** to help you with your wellbeing in the online space. I'll also document what I've learned in **my journey** as a content creator.

Transparency, [intersectionality](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intersectionality), and a [multidisciplinary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/multidisciplinary) approach are very important to me. Academic research will be a part of the writing process for most articles.

The plan is to focus on **creator wellbeing**, and to include **guides** and **product reviews** down the line. I'd also like to expand my articles to content consumers, with articles on **mental health**.

If you want to become a content creator, or are already a content creator, you'll likely find value on this blog.

This is my **first ever blog**, and I'm excited to share my experience and story with you. I hope you'll come along for the ride.

I hope you're as excited as I am.

Want to **connect** with me? You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/glitchedinorbit) or send me an [email](mailto:glitchedinorbit@gmail.com).

I'd love to hear from you.
